This is TFT_eSPI v2.5.43 by Bodmer.
It is not modified, and we pass all credit to the creator.

```cpp
#include "imports/ArduinoJson/ArduinoJson.h"
```

instead of

```cpp
#include <ArduinoJson.h>
```

It is included here, so users don't have to install it when cloning this repository.

(!!!) Also, we try to automatically adjust the clients `User_Setup_Select.h` based on the active board (currently only for lilygo t-display and ttgo-t1).
