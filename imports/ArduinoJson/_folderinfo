This is ArduinoJson v7.4.2 by Benoit.
It is not modified, and we pass all credit to the creator.
The include statements are changed to fit this file structure.

```cpp
#include "imports/ArduinoJson/ArduinoJson.h"
```

instead of

```cpp
#include <ArduinoJson.h>
```

It is included here, so users don't have to install it when cloning this repository.
