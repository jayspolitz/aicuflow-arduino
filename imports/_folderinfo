These are externally imported libraries.
We link them in the project directly for convenience,
so users can just clone this sketch and don't have to
install anything form arduino libraries.

List of libs:

- ArduinoJson v7.4.2 by Benoit (https://arduinojson.org/) `#include <ArduinoJson.h>` -> `#include "imports/ArduinoJson/ArduinoJson.h"`
- TFT_eSPI v2.5.43 by Bodmer (https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) `#include "imports/TFT_eSPI/TFT_eSPI.h"` -> `#include "imports/TFT_eSPI/TFT_eSPI.h"` usually would need customisation but we want to do this automatically
- QRCode v0.0.1 by Richard Moore (installed via arduino)
