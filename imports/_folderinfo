These are externally imported libraries.
We link them in the project directly for convenience,
so users can just clone this sketch and don't have to
install anything form arduino libraries.

List of libs:

- ArduinoJson v7.4.2 by Benoit (https://arduinojson.org/) `#include <ArduinoJson.h>` -> `#include "imports/ArduinoJson/ArduinoJson.h"`
